1) What is Software?
-> software is set of instructions ,data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.

2) What are the types of Applications?
-> these are the types of application in python :

	-Web Development
	-Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
	-Game Development
	-Desktop GUI Development
	-Enterprise/ Business Applications
	-Software Development
	-Educational Purposes 

3) What is programing?
-> A programming language is a computer language that can be used by programmers (developers) to connect
   with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any particular language (C, C++, Java, and 
   Python) to implement a definite task. A programming language can create desktop applications, websites,
   and mobile applications.

4) What is Python?
-> Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python programming
   language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with
   all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited for
   Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.

->   Below are some facts about Python Programming Language:

	Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.
	Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.
	Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to
   type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.
	Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, 
	Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.

	The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the 
	following:
	Machine Learning	
	GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )
	Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)
	Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)
	Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
	Test frameworks
	Multimedia
	Scientific computing
	Text processing and many more..
