1) What is List? How will you reverse a list?
-> Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

   Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of
   data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualitie
   and usage.

   Lists are created using square brackets:[]

	Example :
	   thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
      print(thislist)

->	a built-in function called reverse() is used to reverse the list. This simple and quick way to 
	reverse a list in Python requires little memory. Syntax: list_name. reverse() Here, list_name means 
	you have to write the list's name, which has to be reversed.

	Syntax :

	list.reverse()

2) How will you remove last object from a list? 
   Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]?

-> The method pop() can be used to remove and return the last value from the list or the given index 
   value. If the index is not given, then the last element is popped out and removed.

   list.pop() –
   The simplest approach is to use list’s pop([i]) method which removes and returns an item present at 
   the specified position in the list.

   list.remove() –
   This is another approach where the method remove(x) removes the first item from the list which 
   matches the specified value.
   
-> list[2, 33, 222, 14, 25]
	list[-1] 25

3) Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 
-> Append() :

	You should use this method when you want to add a single item to the end of a list.

   You can add items of any data type since lists can have elements of different data types.

	To call the .append() method, you will need to use this syntax:
	
	<list>.append.(<item>)

	Extend() :
	
	You should use this method if you need to append several items to a list as individual items.

	example :

	 x = [1, 2, 3]
    x.extend([4, 5])
    print (x)
