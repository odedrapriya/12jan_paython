1) What is List? How will you reverse a list?
-> Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

   Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of
   data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualitie
   and usage.

   Lists are created using square brackets:[]

	Example :
	   thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
      print(thislist)

->	a built-in function called reverse() is used to reverse the list. This simple and quick way to 
	reverse a list in Python requires little memory. Syntax: list_name. reverse() Here, list_name means 
	you have to write the list's name, which has to be reversed.

	Syntax :

	list.reverse()

2) How will you remove last object from a list? 
   Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]?

-> The method pop() can be used to remove and return the last value from the list or the given index 
   value. If the index is not given, then the last element is popped out and removed.

   list.pop() –
   The simplest approach is to use list’s pop([i]) method which removes and returns an item present at 
   the specified position in the list.

   list.remove() –
   This is another approach where the method remove(x) removes the first item from the list which 
   matches the specified value.
   
-> list[2, 33, 222, 14, 25]
	list[-1] 25

3) Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 
-> Append() :

	You should use this method when you want to add a single item to the end of a list.

   You can add items of any data type since lists can have elements of different data types.

	To call the .append() method, you will need to use this syntax:
	
	<list>.append.(<item>)

	Extend() :
	
	You should use this method if you need to append several items to a list as individual items.

	example :

	 x = [1, 2, 3]
    x.extend([4, 5])
    print (x)

4) How will you compare two lists?

-> Counter() class can be used to compare lists. The counter() function counts the frequency of the 
   items in a list and stores the data as a dictionary object in the format value:frequency . If two 
   lists have the same dictionary output, you can infer that the lists are the same.

	Using list.sort() and == operator
	The list.sort() method sorts the two lists and the == operator compares the two lists item by 
	item which means they have equal data items at equal positions. This checks if the list contains 
	equal data item values but it does not take into account the order of elements in the list. This
	means that the list [1,2,3] will be equal to the list [2,1,3] according to this method of comparison.

5) How will you create a dictionary using tuples in python?

-> use the dict() function to convert a tuple to a dictionary. A dictionary object can be created with 
   the dict() function. The dictionary is returned by the dict() method, which takes a tuple of tuples 
   as an argument.

	example :
	 		
				t = ((1, 'a'),(2, 'b'))
				dict(t)
	out put :
				{1: 'a', 2: 'b'}

6) How Do You Traverse Through A Dictionary Object In Python?

-> Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map,
   unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds the key: value 
   pair. 

	There are multiple ways to iterate over a dictionary in Python.

	Access key using the build .keys() 
	Access key without using a key() 
	Iterate through all values using .values()
	Iterate through all key, and value pairs using items()
	Access both key and value without using items()
	Print items in Key-Value in pair 

7) How Do You Check The Presence Of A Key In A Dictionary? 

-> you can check if a key exists or not in a dictionary using if-in statement/in operator, get(),
   keys(), handling 'KeyError' exception, and in versions older than Python 3, using has_key().
