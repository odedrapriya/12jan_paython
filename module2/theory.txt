1) How memory is managed in Python?
-> Memory allocation is an essential part of the memory management for a developer. 
   This process basically allots free space in the computer's virtual memory, and 
   are two types of virtual memory works while executing programs.

	Static Memory Allocation
	Dynamic Memory Allocation

	Static Memory Allocation -
	Static memory allocation happens at the compile time. For example - In C/C++, we 
	declare a static array with the fixed sizes. Memory is allocated at the time of 
	compilation. However, we cannot use the memory again in the further program.

	Dynamic Memory Allocation
	Unlike static memory allocation, Dynamic memory allocates the memory at the runtime
    to the program. For example - In C/C++, there is a predefined size of the integer of
    float data type but there is no predefine size of the data types. Memory is allocated to the objects at the 
    run time. We use the Heap for implement dynamic memory management. We can use the memory throughout the program.


2) What is the purpose continue statement in python?
-> It returns the control to the beginning of the while loop.. The continue statement rejects all the remaining 
   statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop.

   The continue statement can be used in both while and for loops.
